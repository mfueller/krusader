      <title>General</title>
      <para>This is a rather short but important section that will
      go into the details of controlling &krusader;.
      This section does not try to cover all the various key
      combinations for two reasons: 
      <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
        <listitem>
          <para>there are just too many of them</para>
        </listitem>

          <link linkend="konfig-panel">Konfigurator Panel page</link></para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>We will only mention the most important
      keyboard shortcuts with the default configuration, but keep
      in mind that most of the <link linkend="key_bindings">Key-Bindings</link> are
      configurable. If you find that you use a certain command a
      lot and want to know the shortcut for this command, or you
      want to change this command shortcut, then check out the
      <link linkend="key_bindings">Configure Shortcuts</link> window (<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu> 
      <guimenuitem>Configure Shortcuts...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>).</para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="moving-around">
      <title>Moving Around</title>
      <para>By Moving Around we mean the transfer of the keyboard
      and mouse focus between the different parts of the
      &krusader; 
      <link linkend="mainwindow">main window</link>. The focus can
      be in one of five places: the Left or Right Panel, the Menu
      Bar, the Command Line or the Terminal Emulator. The panel
      that has the focus is called the Active Panel. An Active
      Panel will remain active until the other panel receives the
      focus (&ie;: if the Left Panel was active and you
      clicked on the Command Line - then the Left Panel remains the
      Active Panel). You must deliberately change which panel is
      active.</para>
      <para>The most common way to transfer the focus to a specific
      panel is to use the mouse to click on that panel. But you
      should be aware of the following: 
      <itemizedlist>

          Emulator, and the

      <para>Type 
      <keycap>foo</keycap>(one character) to do a quick search in
      the Active List Panel for a file beginning with "foo". A
      small quick search dialog box will open below the Active List
      Panel. Type the first few characters of the desired file name
      (more than one character allowed), the cursor will jump to
      that filename (if it exists), &eg; type "ab" to
      search for a file which begins with "ab". The 
      <keycap>Up/Down Arrow</keycap> will jump to the next or
      previous match. &Esc; will close the quick search
      line. The cursor will stay on the last file
      found. The Quicksearch supports <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</ulink> for searching files.</para>

      Type <keycap>foo</keycap> (one character) to filter out from the Active Panel all the files
      that do not have "foo" in names. You can use wildcards for the filtering. &eg; use "a*b" to
      filter files which have "a" and "b" in their names. The Quickfilter follows the

      <title>Executing Files</title>
      <para>You can only execute files in the Active List Panel. To
      execute a file just 
      (double-)click on it or press &Enter; when it
      is under the list cursor. &krusader; will open it
      in the default application for this file type (picture,
      text file...) or the file will be executed (script,
      binary...). If you want to use 
      another application to open the file, 
      click with the &RMB; on the file and go to the <guisubmenu>Open
      with</guisubmenu> sub-menu which will offer more options.
      &krusader; is compatible with the &plasma;
      default file manager for all file types except archives that
      are opened inside the &krusader; panel and not in
      an external application. See 
      <link linkend="konfig-archives">the archives page in

      <para>To copy or move files/directories just select them and
      press 
      <keycap>F5</keycap> to 
      copy or
      <keycap>F6</keycap> to 
      move them. &krusader; tries to preserve the time of
      modification. When copying a directory owner is changed to the user which
      copies the directory, group is changed to the default group of the user.
      When copying a file owner is changed to the user which copies the file,
      group is changed to default group of the user, and permissions are
      preserved. The owner, the group and the permissions are preserved when
      moving file or directory. When copying or moving files/directories a dialog
      appears and allows you to choose the operation destination.
      The default destination is the other-panel browsed directory. If you enter
      a partial &URL;, &krusader; will use the current
      panel directory as the &URL; base.</para>

      The copy, move, pack and unpack operations can be queued.
      After selecting copy or move, hit <keycap>F2</keycap> to use it.
      After selecting pack or unpack, hit <keycap>F2</keycap> to use it. 
      Or the direct shortcuts: copy by queue <keycombo action="simul">&Shift;<keycap>F5</keycap></keycombo> , 
      move by queue <keycombo action="simul">&Shift;<keycap>F6</keycap></keycombo> .
      Queue manager performs actions one-by-one.
      For example, if you have a pen drive (which is slow), and you want to copy 40 files onto it, 
      it is much better copying them one-by-one instead of starting to copy 40 files in parallel.
      That is why enqueuing is important.
      If you pack/unpack 40 files in parallel, you overload your computer,
      but adding them to a queue, is much more useful.

      By <link linkend="konfig-general">default</link> it will be moved to &plasma; Trash.
      You can open the &plasma; Trash with the Trash icon in the <link linkend="main_toolbar">Main Toolbar</link> or with 
      the <filename>trash:/</filename> KIO slave.
      Physically &plasma; Trash is located in <filename>~/.local/share/Trash/</filename> or <filename>Trash</filename> in the subdirectory in user home directory which can be determined using the <userinput>qtpaths --paths GenericDataLocation</userinput> command.
      <keycombo action="simul">&Shift;
      <keycap>Delete</keycap></keycombo> will delete the file

      warn you when deleting non-empty directories. Of course only
      operations that are permitted to do by the Operating
      System will be performed - you will be notified otherwise. If

    <sect2 id="shred">
      <title>Shred Files</title>
      <para>Shred was removed from &kde; 4 (and as consequence &krusader;-2 for &kde; 4).
           The main reason is probably that shredding is filesystem dependent and even if you overwrite the file 100 times, it is not sure, that it will be deleted from the disk finally.
           Quote from the <application>kgpg</application> posts: <quote>The shred feature has been removed from the KDE library. Kgpg will not support this feature anymore. Moderns file systems use journalisation. So the shred feature should be implemented in the file system. Not in kgpg.</quote>
           But you might use a proper shred <link linkend="useractions">UserAction</link> for your filesystem.
	   But keep in mind that if you want to be 100% sure that it is impossible that someone can read a deleted file, you need to destroy your harddrive hardware...
