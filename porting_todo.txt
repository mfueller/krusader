	porting to kde plasma - todos
	=============================


1 - rewrite CMakeLists rules / variables

all rules were rewritten in a Qt5/KF5 way; I didn't changed yet the variables in
'target_link_libraries', just commented out; btw, with a fast 'cmake', all flags
should be generated (flags.make files)

2 - change properly all include

ok, I think I've done it, not sure it's 100% correct, we'll find at compile
time; I choose to use the full include path (QtCore/QFile, e.g.) because it will
be easier to get the qt5/kf5 packages involved

next...

3 - new headers... new methods
